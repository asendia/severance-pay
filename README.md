# severance-pay
Simple web app to calculate Indonesian severance pay. Publicly accessible in [warisin.com/pesangon](https://warisin.com/pesangon) in Bahasa Indonesia

## Disclaimer
This web app may not be accurate and should not be taken as legal advice, I only created this to try out the blazingly fast, golang based JS bundler [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild)

## Install dependencies
Prerequisites: [nodejs](https://github.com/nodejs) & [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn)
```
yarn
```

## Run in local
```
yarn dev
```
Then it should be accessible, usually from `localhost:8000/pesangon/`
